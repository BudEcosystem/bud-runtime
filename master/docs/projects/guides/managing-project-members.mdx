## Overview

Project member management lets you control who can view and operate project resources.

## Invite Members

1. Open the target project.
2. Click **Share** or **Invite**.
3. Add one or more users.
4. Assign permission scope (view/manage).
5. Save and confirm invite status.

## Update Permissions

1. Open project member management.
2. Locate the user.
3. Change role/scope as needed.
4. Save and verify updated access.

## Remove Members

1. Open project member management.
2. Select a user.
3. Click **Remove**.
4. Confirm the action.

## Recommended Access Model

- Grant **manage** only to platform owners and on-call operators.
- Grant **view** to stakeholders who need visibility but not mutation rights.
- Review membership regularly, especially after team changes.
