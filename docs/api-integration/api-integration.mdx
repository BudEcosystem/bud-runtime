## 1. Description

The API Integration module explains how to connect your applications to Bud AI Foundry deployments using OpenAI-compatible APIs, Bud-native endpoints, and SDK-ready workflows. It brings together authentication, endpoint discovery, request formatting, and observability so teams can move from a deployed model to a production-grade integration with consistent governance.

Common integration questions include:

- How do we discover the right endpoint and model ID for a project?

- What headers and authentication are required for every request?

- How do we align timeouts, retries, and streaming with deployment SLOs?

- Where do we monitor usage, cost, and error rates after go-live?

Bud AI Foundry answers these with a unified API layer, project-scoped keys, and built-in monitoring so teams can safely ship AI features across web, mobile, and backend services.

## 2. USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)

### 1. OpenAI-compatible interface

Use familiar request/response formats with optional Bud-native extensions, so existing clients can migrate quickly without rewriting call logic.

### 2. Project-scoped governance

Keys, endpoints, and quotas are tied to projects, making it easy to isolate teams, track usage, and enforce access controls.

### 3. Built-in observability

Every request can be traced across latency, token usage, and error metrics for rapid debugging and capacity planning.

### 4. Flexible deployment targets

API integrations can route to cloud, on-prem, or hybrid deployments without changing your client code.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Endpoint discovery

- Project detail pages surface deployed endpoints, base URLs, and model IDs.

- Deployment pages expose hardware profiles, scaling settings, and routing policies that influence latency and throughput.

### 3.2 Authentication and headers

- Project-scoped API keys with rotation and audit trails.

- Required headers to identify project, environment, and request metadata.

- Optional idempotency keys for safe retries.

### 3.3 OpenAI-compatible operations

- Chat completions, embeddings, and image generation endpoints.

- Streaming and non-streaming responses with consistent error structures.

- Compatible with existing OpenAI SDKs and request schemas.

### 3.4 Bud-native extensions

- Deployment-level routing hints for latency or cost optimization.

- Safety and guardrail toggles aligned with policy settings.

- Request tagging for billing and monitoring segmentation.

### 3.5 Monitoring and troubleshooting

- Real-time metrics on token usage, latency, and request volume.

- Error categorization to distinguish auth, quota, and model failures.

- Logs and traces linked to deployments for faster triage.

## 4. How-to Guides

### 4.1 Locate your endpoint

1. Open the project detail page in Bud AI Foundry.

2. Navigate to the Deployments tab.

3. Select a deployment to view the base URL and model ID.

### 4.2 Create an API key

1. Go to **API Keys** from the navigation.

2. Select the project that will call the endpoint.

3. Generate a key and store it in a secure secret manager.

### 4.3 Make your first request

1. Build a request using the base URL and model ID from the deployment.

2. Include the `Authorization` header with your API key.

3. Send a sample prompt and confirm a successful response.

### 4.4 Enable streaming responses

1. Set the request to streaming mode in your client.

2. Consume the response events as they arrive.

3. Handle stream termination and partial output errors gracefully.

### 4.5 Monitor usage

1. Open the Observability dashboard for the project.

2. Review token usage, latency, and error rates.

3. Adjust retries, timeouts, or deployment scaling as needed.

## 5. Next steps

- Review the [[Authentication guide](https://budecosystem-b7b14df4.mintlify.app/api-integration/authentication)] to set required headers and rotation policies.

- Explore [[Deployments](https://budecosystem-b7b14df4.mintlify.app/deployments/deployments)] for scaling and routing options that impact API performance.

- Use [[Projects](https://budecosystem-b7b14df4.mintlify.app/projects/projects)] to organize keys, endpoints, and access controls.
