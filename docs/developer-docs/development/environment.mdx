# Development Workflow

This guide outlines the best practices and workflow for setting up and contributing to the Bud Runtime project. It covers environment setup, configuration, and deployment processes to ensure a smooth development experience. Follow these steps to get started.

> [!TIP]
> An example commit for setting up PDE: https://github.com/BudEcosystem/bud-runtime/pull/182/commits/5518f3ad489ce21a7a67e74d3e3497c6b5b5f27e

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with access to the repository.
- An SSH key pair (if you don't have one, generate it with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`).
- A name or pseudonym (e.g., your username) that will be used for your development environment URL (e.g., `<name>.bud.studio`).

## Step 1: Install Nix

If Nix is not already installed on your system, install it using the Determinate Systems installer:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Verify Nix is installed by running `nix --version`.

## Step 2: Enter the Nix Development Shell

Clone the repository (if not already done) and navigate to the project root. Then, enter the Nix shell to set up the development environment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BudEcosystem/bud-runtime.git
cd bud-runtime
nix develop
```

This will provide you with the necessary tools and dependencies.

**Tip:** If you encounter missing command-line packages (not Python packages), add them to `nix/shell/default.nix` and re-enter the Nix development shell with `nix develop`. Avoid installing packages locally to maintain reproducibility.

## Step 3: Set Up SOPS for Secrets Management

Run the following command to generate a public key for SOPS (Secrets Operations):

```bash
bud_sops
```

Copy the output public key and add it to the `.sops.yaml` file in the project root. Edit the file to include your key under the appropriate section (e.g., under `creation_rules` and `keys`).

## Step 4: Generate WireGuard Configuration

Generate a WireGuard config for secure access. The usage is:

```bash
bud_wg <host_addr> <name>
```

- `<host_addr>`: A unique host address. Check `nix/nixos/master/modules/wireguard.nix` for existing addresses to avoid conflicts. should be in the range 5-100
- `<name>`: Your name or pseudonym.

Copy the output, which includes the private key, and save it securely (e.g., in a local file). Do not commit the private key to the repository.

## Step 5: Add WireGuard Config to the Repository

Add the generated WireGuard configuration (last block) to `nix/nixos/master/modules/wireguard.nix`. Follow the existing format in the file.

## Step 6: Add Your SSH Key

Add your public SSH key to `infra/nixos/common/modules/users.nix`. This grants you access to the infrastructure. Insert it under the relevant user section.

## Step 7: Add Your Environment Name to DNS Configuration

Add your name or pseudonym to `infra/tofu/budk8s/dns.tf`. This will be used as the environment name, and your dev environment will be served at `<name>.bud.studio`. Follow the existing entries as a template.

## Step 8: Create Helm Values Override File

Create a new file at `infra/helm/bud/values.<name>.yaml`, where `<name>` is your name or pseudonym. Use `infra/helm/bud/values.sinan.yaml` as a template.

In this file, define your overrides. At minimum, set:

```yaml
ingress:
  hosts:
    root: <name>.bud.studio
```

Customize other values as needed for your environment.

## Step 9: Create a Pull Request

Commit your changes and create a pull request (PR) on GitHub. In the PR description, ping `@sinanmohd` for review.

**Best Practice:** To avoid breaking the development environment, test significant changes or large PRs on your personal development environment (PDE) before merging to master.

After the PR is reviewed and merged, wait for the CI/CD pipeline to pick up the changes. You'll receive a Slack notification once the deployment is complete.

## Step 10: Install WireGuard Client

Download and install the WireGuard client for your OS:

- **macOS**: Use the official app from the App Store: [WireGuard for macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025?mt=12).
- **Linux**: Follow the installation guide for your distribution. For example, on Arch Linux, refer to the [Arch Wiki WireGuard page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/WireGuard#wg-quick). Use `wg-quick` for quick setup.

Import your saved WireGuard configuration (from Step 4) into the client and connect to the VPN.

## Step 11: Enter Nix Develop Shell

Once connected via WireGuard, run:

```bash
nix develop
```

This will give you access to the Bud Kubernetes (k8s) cluster.

## Step 12: Deploy Your Environment

Start deploying your development environment with:

```bash
bud_pde <name>
```

Replace `<name>` with your name or pseudonym. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues.

## Best Practices

- Keep your PDE up-to-date and use it for testing to prevent disruptions.
- Ensure all dependencies are managed through Nix for consistency across environments.
- All secrets should be committed to git after encrypting with SOPS.

Once set up, you'll have full access to deploy and manage your dev environment at `<name>.bud.studio`. Follow these guidelines to contribute effectively to Bud Runtime!
