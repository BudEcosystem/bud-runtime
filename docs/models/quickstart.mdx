## Step 3: Configure model details

Provide required fields for the selected source:

- model name,

## Step 4: Submit and monitor status

1. Submit the onboarding form.
2. Watch progress for ingestion or linking.
3. Open model details to confirm readiness indicators.

## Step 5: Validate repository presence
