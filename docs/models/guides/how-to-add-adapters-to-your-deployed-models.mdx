title: "How to Add Adapters to Your Deployed Models"
description: "Deploy and manage adapters dynamically for task-specific inference with shared infrastructure"
---

Bud AI Foundry updates to Model Adapters make it easier to run many domain-specific model behaviors on nearly the same infrastructure as one base deployment.

## Key capabilities

- **Dynamic adapter loading**: add or remove adapters while a model stays live, with no service interruption.
- **Multi-domain inference on shared infrastructure**: run legal, finance, support, and document-focused behaviors on shared GPU capacity.
- **Adapter-level monitoring and analytics**: track usage and behavior per adapter for governance and audits.

## Step-by-step guide

1. Open **Models** and add your adapter model to the model catalog first.
1. Go to **Projects** and select the project that contains your deployed base model.
1. Open **Deployments** and then open the target deployment detail page.
1. In deployment details, open the **Adapters** tab.
1. Click **Add Adapter**.
1. In **Select Adapter Model**, choose the adapter model that you already added in **Models**.
3. Enter adapter deployment details (for example, adapter deployment name) and continue.
4. Deploy adapter and monitor status until completion.
5. Validate adapter behavior with use-case specific prompts.
6. Use adapter-level metrics and logs for ongoing optimization.

**Important:** The **Add Adapter** flow in deployment details only lists adapter-compatible models from the catalog. If your adapter model is not visible, first add/publish it from the **Models** page.

## Why this matters

- Launch specialized AI capabilities faster.
- Reduce infrastructure cost by reusing shared base deployments.
- Improve control and visibility with adapter-level governance data.

## Suggested rollout strategy

1. Start with one high-value domain adapter.
2. Compare quality and cost against deploying a separate full model.
3. Expand to additional adapters once baseline SLAs are met.
4. Establish adapter naming, ownership, and review standards.
