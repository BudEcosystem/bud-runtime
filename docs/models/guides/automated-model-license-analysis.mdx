title: "Automated Model License Analysis"
description: "Use Bud AI Foundry to evaluate whether model licenses match your intended usage before deployment"
---

If you are deciding between model families like LLAMA and Qwen—or even between close variants like LLAMA 3.1 and LLAMA 3.2—licensing often becomes the deciding factor.

Bud AI Foundry includes a built-in license analysis experience so your team can review license details directly in the model workflow, instead of manually parsing long legal text each time.

## What this feature solves

- Reduces manual license interpretation work.
- Gives teams a repeatable review step before onboarding or deployment.
- Surfaces license details and FAQs in one place for faster decisions.

## How it works in Bud

The model details flow supports viewing license details and FAQs, including license files/URLs and structured Q&A content.

    D --> E{Aligned With Use Case?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Approve for Deployment]
    E -->|No| G[Select Alternate Model]
```

## Recommended decision workflow

1. Identify candidate models for the task.
2. Open each model's license details page.
3. Compare usage constraints against your product scenario.
4. Record your approval/rejection outcome with rationale.
5. Continue onboarding/deployment only for approved candidates.

<Tip>
Treat license review as a required quality gate, alongside performance and security checks.
