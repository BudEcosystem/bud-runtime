## Overview

Bud AI Foundry Pipelines enable you to automate complex workflows through visual, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Build workflows that orchestrate deployments, manage clusters, and coordinate multi-step processes - all from an intuitive drag-and-drop editor.

## Key Features

**Visual Pipeline Editor**
Build workflows with drag-and-drop. Connect actions, configure parameters, and visualize execution flow - no code required.

**Event-Driven Execution**
Trigger pipelines automatically based on platform events like deployments, cluster changes, or custom triggers.

**Complete Observability**
Track every execution with detailed logs, status monitoring, and execution history stored in PostgreSQL.

**Built-in Reliability**
Automatic retries, conditional branching, and error handling ensure your workflows complete successfully.

## Available Actions

Pipelines provide actions across multiple categories:

| Category | Description | Key Actions |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Control Flow** | Logic and routing | Log, Conditional Branch, Transform, Aggregate, Wait Until |
| **Deployment** | Model deployment operations | Deploy Model, Scale Deployment, Configure Rate Limiting |
| **Model Operations** | Model management | Add Model, Add Cloud Model, Benchmark Model |
| **Cluster** | Infrastructure operations | Cluster Health Check |
| **Integration** | External services | HTTP Request, Send Notification |

<Info>
All actions support custom parameters, automatic retries, and timeout configuration. Use the visual editor to discover and configure actions.

## How It Works

1. **Create** - Build your pipeline in the visual editor
2. **Configure** - Set up triggers (manual, scheduled, or event-based)
3. **Execute** - Run pipelines on-demand or automatically
4. **Monitor** - Track execution status and view detailed logs
