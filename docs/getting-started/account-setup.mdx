Set up your Bud AI Foundry workspace so you can manage projects, deployments, and access controls from day one.

## 1. Description

Bud AI Foundry accounts are structured around workspaces and projects. Workspaces manage billing, identity, and security settings, while projects organize models, deployments, and API keys for each team or application.

## 2. Create your workspace

1. Sign in to the Bud AI Foundry console with SSO or email credentials.
2. Open User Management from the workspace settings menu.
2. Invite teammates by email and assign their roles (viewer, editor, admin etc).
3. Save changes to provision access across projects and models.

## 3. Create your first project

1. Go to Projects and select Create Project.
2. Enter a project name, description, and tags.
3. Assign owners and define default guardrail policies.

## 4. Set up API keys

1. Go to API Keys and select the project that will call model endpoints.
2. Generate project-scoped keys for production and staging environments.
3. Store keys in a secure secret manager and plan rotation schedules.

## 5. Review billing and notifications

1. Confirm billing details and usage thresholds for the workspace.
2. Configure notifications for quota alerts, deployment events, and evaluation results.
3. Align cost centers with project tags for chargeback reporting.
