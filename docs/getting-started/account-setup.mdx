Set up your Bud AI Foundry workspace so you can manage projects, deployments, and access controls from day one.

## 1. Description

Bud AI Foundry accounts are structured around workspaces and projects. Workspaces manage billing, identity, and security settings, while projects organize models, deployments, and API keys for each team or application.

## 2. Create your workspace

1. Sign in to the Bud AI Foundry console with SSO or email credentials.
2. Open User Management from the workspace settings menu.
2. Invite teammates by email and assign their roles (viewer, editor, admin etc).
3. Save changes to provision access across projects and models.

## 3. Set up access controls

1. Configure SSO or identity provider settings for centralized login.
2. Define role-based access so only authorized users can deploy or delete models.
3. Review audit logs to validate onboarding activity.

## 4. Create your first project

1. Go to Projects and select Create Project.
2. Enter a project name, description, and tags.
3. Generate API keys for application teams that will call model endpoints.
