Use these definitions to navigate the Bud AI Foundry platform and documentation.

## 1. Projects

Projects are the primary workspace for teams. Each project contains its own models, deployments, endpoints, and API keys so you can isolate workloads by application or business unit.

## 2. Models

Models are registered artifacts or managed APIs that power inference. Bud AI Foundry supports cloud providers, Hugging Face repositories, URL-based imports, and disk-mounted checkpoints, all governed under a single catalog.

## 3. Clusters

Clusters represent the infrastructure where models run. They can be cloud-managed Kubernetes clusters or on-prem hardware pools, and they define the compute profiles available to deployments.

## 4. Endpoints

Endpoints expose deployed models to applications through OpenAI-compatible APIs. They can include routing rules, fallback strategies, and access policies.

## 5. Deployments

Deployments are the runtime instances of models attached to clusters. They include configuration details like hardware settings, scaling policies, and safety controls.

## 6. Evaluations

Evaluations measure quality, latency, and safety using datasets and benchmarks so teams can choose the best model and configuration before promoting to production.
