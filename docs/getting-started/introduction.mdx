# Introduction to Bud AI Foundry

Bud AI Foundry is a full-stack platform for deploying, governing, and optimizing GenAI workloads across cloud and on-prem infrastructure. It brings model management, secure runtime controls, and OpenAI-compatible APIs into a single workflow so teams can ship AI features without stitching together multiple tools.

## What is Bud AI Foundry?

Bud AI Foundry was created to make GenAI accessible and sustainable. Instead of locking teams into expensive GPU-only stacks, the platform optimizes inference and routing on commodity hardware while still allowing burst-to-accelerator when latency or throughput requires it. This approach reduces cost, avoids hardware scarcity, and helps enterprises move from prototype to production faster.

## Key Benefits

### 2.1 GPU-optional deployment

Start with CPU-first deployments and burst to GPUs only when latency or throughput targets require it.

### 2.2 Unified model lifecycle

Register, evaluate, and version cloud and local models in one catalog with consistent metadata and approvals.

### 2.3 Built-in governance

Apply guardrails, signing, and audit controls to models, routes, and deployments so teams stay compliant.

### 2.4 OpenAI-compatible API

Ship integrations faster with drop-in compatibility for chat, embeddings, vision, and multimodal workflows.

### 2.5 Performance and cost visibility

Track usage, latency, and spend across providers and clusters to optimize workloads continuously.

## Primary Use Cases

- **Enterprise GenAI enablement:** Deliver a governed model hub and standardized deployment workflows for multiple teams.

- **Hybrid inference:** Balance on-prem models with cloud APIs while keeping routing and safety controls centralized.

- **Cost optimization:** Use routing and observability to shift workloads to the most cost-efficient backend.

- **Production readiness:** Validate, benchmark, and monitor models before promoting them to critical applications.
