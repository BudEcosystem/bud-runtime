# Introduction to Bud AI Foundry

Bud AI Foundry is a full-stack platform for deploying, governing, and optimizing GenAI workloads across cloud and on-prem infrastructure. It brings model management, secure runtime controls, and OpenAI-compatible APIs into a single workflow so teams can ship AI features without stitching together multiple tools.

## What is Bud AI Foundry?

Bud AI Foundry was created to make GenAI accessible and sustainable. Instead of locking teams into expensive GPU-only stacks, the platform optimizes inference and routing on commodity hardware while still allowing burst-to-accelerator when latency or throughput requires it. This approach reduces cost, avoids hardware scarcity, and helps enterprises move from prototype to production faster.
