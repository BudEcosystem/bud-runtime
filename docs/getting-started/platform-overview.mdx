# Platform Overview

Bud AI Foundry is organized as a secure control plane for governance and a flexible data plane for inference workloads. This structure lets platform teams standardize policies while still giving application teams the flexibility to ship models quickly.

## 1. Description

Bud AI Foundry brings together model onboarding, deployment, routing, observability, and evaluation into a single platform. It supports hybrid environments so teams can run cloud APIs, local checkpoints, and private model endpoints under the same governance and monitoring framework.

## 2. Architecture Flow

1. **Model onboarding:** Register cloud models or import local checkpoints into the Model Hub with metadata and approvals.
2. **Deployment:** Configure clusters, runtime settings, and safety controls, then deploy models to cloud or on-prem infrastructure.
3. **Routing and endpoints:** Expose models through OpenAI-compatible endpoints and apply traffic rules across deployments.
4. **Observability:** Monitor latency, tokens, cost, and safety metrics while capturing audit trails for compliance.

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 Model Hub

A governed catalog for cloud and local models with versioning, metadata, evaluation results, and approvals.

### 3.2 Projects and workspaces

Organize teams, workloads, and access controls so each project has its own models, deployments, and API keys.

### 3.3 Clusters and deployments

Connect Kubernetes or managed infrastructure, define runtime configurations, and deploy models to the right hardware.

### 3.4 Endpoints and routing

Publish OpenAI-compatible endpoints and control traffic splitting, fallback, and CPU/GPU placement policies.

### 3.5 Observability and evaluation

Track inference performance, costs, and safety signals while running structured evaluations and benchmarks.
