## Overview

Bud Runtime supports image generation through various AI models, providing a unified API for creating images from text prompts.

## Supported Models

- Stable Diffusion (SD 1.5, SDXL)
- Custom fine-tuned models
- LoRA-enhanced models

## Basic Usage

### Generate an Image

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-gateway/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A serene landscape with mountains and a lake",
    "n": 1,
    "size": "1024x1024"
  }'
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "created": 1234567890,
  "data": [
    {
      "url": "https://your-storage/image-id.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Using LoRA Models

Combine base models with LoRA adapters for specialized image generation:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Portrait in anime style",
  "model": "stable-diffusion-xl",
  "lora": "anime-style-v2",
  "lora_weight": 0.8
}
```

### Batch Generation

Generate multiple images in a single request:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Futuristic cityscape",
  "n": 4,
  "size": "512x512",
  "seed": 42
}
```

## Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate image sizes for your use case
- Enable caching for frequently used prompts
- Consider batch processing for multiple generations

## Best Practices

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Be specific and descriptive in your prompts
2. **Resource Management**: Monitor GPU usage when generating large images
3. **Quality Settings**: Balance between generation speed and image quality
