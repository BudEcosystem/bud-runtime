This quick start shows how to create a project, add collaborators, and validate core tabs so your team can start deploying models safely.

## Quickstart Flow

    E --> F[Configure Reliability]
```


## Step 1: Open Projects

1. Sign in to Bud AI Foundry.
2. In the left navigation, click **Projects**.
3. Click **+ Project**.

## Step 2: Create the Project

1. Enter a project name, for example: `Customer Support AI`.
2. Add a short description and tags.
3. Pick an icon to make the project easy to identify.
4. Click **Create**.

<Info>
Use names that map to a product or business capability. This makes routing, access reviews, and observability easier at scale.
</Info>

## Step 3: Add Members

1. Open the created project.
2. Use **Share/Invite** to add collaborators.
3. Assign permissions (view/manage) based on responsibilities.
4. Save changes and verify members appear in the project header or member list.

## Step 4: Validate Project Tabs

Open each core tab and confirm it loads correctly:

- **Deployments**
- **Agents**
- **Routes**
- **Analytics**
- **Clusters**
- **Observability**
- **Guardrails**

## Step 5: Prepare for First Deployment

1. Go to **Deployments**.
2. Click **Create Deployment** (or equivalent action in your environment).
3. Select a model and target cluster.
4. Review status once deployment starts.

## Step 6: Configure Baseline Reliability

After deployment is active, open deployment **Settings** and configure:

- Rate limiting
- Retry/fallback behavior
- Autoscaling bounds (minimum/maximum replicas)

You now have a project ready for production-oriented workflows. 🎉
