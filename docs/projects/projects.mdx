## 1. Description

The Projects module in Bud Admin groups every artifact—models, deployments, routes, analytics, and guardrails—into collaborative workspaces. Each project anchors cloud and local model deployments (Hugging Face, URL-based, and disk-based) so teams can ship GPU-optional GenAI experiences with shared governance, observability, and access control. Projects expose structured tabs for Deployments, Agents, Routes, Analytics, Clusters, Observability, and Guardrails, mirroring the Bud platform’s focus on running production workloads without costly GPU dependence.

## 2. USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)

### 1. GPU-optional delivery for cloud and local models

Organize cloud endpoints and local checkpoints (Hugging Face, URL, disk) under one project so teams can mix CPU-first inference with burst-to-cloud flexibility inspired by Bud’s GPU-free GenAI approach.

### 2. One workspace for every workflow

Deployments, agents/prompts, routing tables, analytics, clusters, and guardrails live in a single project page—no context switching across tools.

### 3. Granular collaboration and permissions

Project-level view/manage scopes, invitations, and member removal give admins control over who can create, edit, or delete projects, deployments, and routes.

### 4. Governed lifecycle with safety controls

Guardrail tab centralizes safety policies, while project-level delete/edit actions respect active deployment checks to prevent accidental outages.

### 5. Built-in observability and benchmarking

Analytics and Observability tabs expose latency, throughput, TTFT, queuing, and inference timelines so teams can benchmark backends and route traffic confidently.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Project creation and metadata

- Create projects with names, icons, and descriptions from the global Projects list.
- Tag projects for discovery and filtering. Tags also appear on the project detail header.
- Edit project metadata from the detail page without impacting existing deployments or members.

### 3.2 Member and permission management

- Invite users with scoped permissions (project:view/manage, endpoint:view/manage) and remove them when access changes.
- Share projects from cards or the detail header.

### 3.3 Deployments

- View deployment table scoped to the project, including endpoint counts and status.
- Launch or delete deployments with permission-aware controls; delete project guarded when deployments are active.

### 3.4 Agents

- List agents and prompts tied to the project for reuse across routes and applications.
- Centralize prompt assets beside deployments to keep routing decisions contextual.

### 3.5 Routes

- Define and inspect traffic routes to steer workloads across cloud/local backends.
- Keep routing logic close to deployment metadata to simplify rollback or traffic shifting.

### 3.6 Analytics

- Pull project metrics (latency, throughput, TTFT, concurrency, queuing) via unified observability adapters.
- Compare average and percentile performance across deployments to guide cost/quality choices.

### 3.7 Clusters

- List clusters associated with the project for placement awareness.
- Jump into cluster detail tabs (General, Deployments, Nodes, Analytics in dev mode, Settings) from the project context.

### 3.8 Observability

- Review inference events and logs per project to debug behavior without leaving the workspace.
- Surface real-time signals for CPU-first or burst-to-GPU/HPU etc deployments.

### 3.9 Guardrails

- Attach and monitor guardrail policies alongside deployments.
- Enable or disable guardrails per project to align with compliance needs before enforcing them in routes.

### 3.10 Project deletion safeguards

- Delete action prompts warnings when deployments exist, blocking removal until endpoints are removed.
- Overlay confirmation keeps observability overlays and notifications synchronized with the action result.

## 5. FAQs

**Q1. Can a project mix cloud and local models?**

Yes. Projects group deployments from cloud APIs and local checkpoints (Hugging Face, URL-based, disk-based) so routing and governance stay consistent across backends.

**Q2. What happens if I try to delete a project with active deployments?**

Deletion is blocked with a warning until you delete running deployments, preventing accidental outages.

**Q3. How do permissions work for collaborators?**

Admins can invite members with view or manage scopes for projects and endpoints. Permissions drive which buttons (create, edit, delete, share) appear on list and detail pages.

**Q4. Where can I see performance metrics?**

Use the Analytics tab for aggregated metrics and the Observability tab for inference-level logs to diagnose latency, TTFT, and throughput issues.

**Q5. Are guardrails mandatory?**

Guardrails are optional per project and surfaced in a dedicated tab. Teams can enable them in dev mode to pilot safety policies before enforcing them in production routes.

**Q6. How do I inspect deployment specifics?**

Open a deployment from the Deployments tab to reach its detail page, then use General, Workers (local deployments), Settings, Benchmarks, and Model Evaluations to review configuration and performance.

**Q7. How are agents reused across the project?**

The Agents tab centralizes prompts/agents so you can edit once and reuse them across routes and apps without duplicating configurations.

**Q8. How do routes get configured for a project?**

Open the Routes tab, and define traffic targets to balance requests between cloud and local deployments within the project.

**Q9. How do I integrate a deployment after selecting “Use this model”?**

Open Use this model from the deployment row to copy ready-made snippets in cURL, Python, or JavaScript that call the project endpoint, so external applications can integrate directly with your Bud deployment.

**Q10. What happens when I publish a model?**

Publishing sets token pricing (input/output, USD per selected token block) and makes the endpoint available in the Bud customer dashboard for org users. You can revisit Publish Details to review pricing history, adjust prices, or unpublish without deleting the deployment.7Us.
