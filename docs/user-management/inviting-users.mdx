# Inviting Users

Add team members to your Bud Stack organization and manage their access levels. This guide covers how to invite both Admin and Client users.

## Prerequisites

To invite users, you must:
- Have an Admin account with **User Management** permission
- Be logged into the Bud Stack dashboard
- Have the user's email address

<Warning>
Only users with the USER_MANAGE permission can invite new users to the organization.
</Warning>

## User Types Overview

Before inviting users, understand the two main user types:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Admin Users" icon="user-shield">
    Administrative users with elevated privileges for managing infrastructure, models, clusters, and other users.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Client Users" icon="user">
    Regular users who can create and manage projects, deploy models, and use endpoints within their projects.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Inviting a New User

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to User Management">
    From the dashboard sidebar, click on **User Management** to access the users page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Invite User'">
    Click the **Invite User** or **Add User** button in the top-right corner of the users page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in User Details">
    Complete the invitation form with the following information:

    - **Name**: Full name of the user
    - **Email**: User's email address (must be unique)
    - **User Type**: Select either Admin or Client
    - **Role**: (For Admin users) Select from SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, DEVELOPER, DEVOPS, or TESTER
    - **Company**: (Optional) User's company name
    - **Purpose**: (Optional) Intended use case
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    Click **Send Invitation** to create the user account and send the invitation email.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens After Invitation?

### For the New User

1. **Receives Email**: The user receives an invitation email with instructions
2. **Creates Password**: User clicks the link and sets their password in Keycloak
3. **First Login**: User logs into Bud Stack for the first time
4. **Account Activation**: Account status changes from **INVITED** to **ACTIVE**

### For Client Users (Automatic Setup)

When a Client user is invited, the system automatically:
- ✅ Creates a default project
- ✅ Assigns a free billing plan
- ✅ Grants basic permissions (PROJECT_VIEW, PROJECT_MANAGE)
- ✅ Sets up notification preferences

### For Admin Users

Admin users receive:
- ✅ Module-level permissions based on their role
- ✅ Access to admin dashboard features
- ✅ No default project (can create as needed)

## Admin Roles Explained

When inviting Admin users, you can assign one of five roles:

<Accordion title="SUPER_ADMIN - Highest Privileges">
  Complete access to all platform features including:
  - User management (create, edit, delete users)
  - Cluster management (all clouds)
  - Model repository access
  - Billing and organization settings
  - System configuration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ADMIN - High-Level Management">
  Management access to most features:
  - User management
  - Project oversight
  - Model and endpoint management
  - Cluster management
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DEVELOPER - Standard Development Access (Default)">
  Standard development permissions:
  - Project creation and management
  - Model deployment
  - Endpoint management
  - Limited cluster access
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DEVOPS - Infrastructure Focus">
  Specialized for infrastructure management:
  - Cluster management
  - Deployment configuration
  - Performance optimization
  - Infrastructure monitoring
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="TESTER - QA and Testing">
  Testing and validation focus:
  - Evaluation access
  - Benchmark running
  - Model testing
  - Playground access
</Accordion>

<Note>
The DEVELOPER role is the default for newly created Admin users. You can change roles later from the user edit page.
</Note>

## Invitation Email Content

The invitation email contains:
- Welcome message
- Link to set up password
- Instructions for first login
- Support contact information

<Tip>
Invitation links typically expire after 24-48 hours. If a user doesn't activate their account in time, you can resend the invitation or manually activate their account.
</Tip>

## Managing Pending Invitations

### View Invitation Status

On the User Management page, you can see user status:
- 🟢 **ACTIVE**: User has completed setup and logged in
- 🟡 **INVITED**: Invitation sent, awaiting user activation
- 🔴 **DELETED**: User account has been deactivated

### Resend Invitation

If a user hasn't received the invitation email:

1. Find the user in the users list
2. Click the **Actions** menu (⋮)
3. Select **Resend Invitation**
4. A new invitation email will be sent

### Cancel Invitation

To cancel a pending invitation:

1. Find the user with INVITED status
2. Click the **Actions** menu (⋮)
3. Select **Delete User**
4. Confirm the deletion

## Bulk User Invitation

<Info>
Currently, users must be invited individually through the UI. Bulk import via CSV or API is planned for a future release.
</Info>

For large organizations, you can use the API to automate user creation:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bud.studio/users/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane@company.com",
    "user_type": "CLIENT",
    "role": "DEVELOPER"
  }'
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="signature">
    Use full names to make it easier to identify users in activity logs and audit trails.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Choose Appropriate Roles" icon="user-tag">
    Assign the minimum necessary permissions. Start with DEVELOPER role for Admin users.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Verify Email Addresses" icon="envelope-circle-check">
    Double-check email addresses before sending invitations to avoid security issues.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Document Purpose" icon="clipboard-list">
    Use the "Purpose" field to track why each user was added to the organization.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### User Didn't Receive Invitation Email

1. Check spam/junk folders
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Resend invitation from the UI
4. Contact support if issue persists

### User Can't Activate Account

1. Ensure invitation link hasn't expired
2. Check if user already has a Keycloak account with that email
3. Try resending invitation
4. Contact support for manual activation

### Permission Errors After Invitation

If a user reports missing permissions:
1. Verify their user type and role are correct
2. Check their permissions in User Management
3. User may need to log out and log back in
4. Refer to [Roles & Permissions](/user-management/roles-permissions) guide

## API Reference

For developers integrating user invitation programmatically:

```python
import requests

# Create a new user
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.bud.studio/users/",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "user_type": "CLIENT",  # or "ADMIN"
        "role": "DEVELOPER",     # for Admin users only
        "company": "Acme Corp",
        "purpose": "Model deployment"
    }
)

if response.status_code == 201:
    user = response.json()
    print(f"User created with ID: {user['id']}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.json()}")
```

<Note>
Requires API key with USER_MANAGE permission. See [API Keys](/api-keys/creating-api-keys) for setup.
</Note>

## Next Steps

After inviting users:
1. Share onboarding documentation with new users
2. Set up project permissions for Client users
3. Configure SSO if needed for enterprise
4. Monitor user activity in audit logs
