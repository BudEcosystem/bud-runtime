# User Types & Permissions

Bud Stack uses a straightforward permission system based on **user types** and **resource-level access**. The platform has two main user types, each with access to different dashboards and capabilities.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Admin Users" icon="user-shield">
    Administrative users who access the **Admin Dashboard** for platform management, infrastructure control, user management, and cluster operations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Client Users" icon="user">
    Standard users who access the **Customer Dashboard** for deploying AI/ML models, managing projects, creating endpoints, and monitoring their deployments.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Permission System Overview

Bud Stack implements a simple, effective permission model:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User Type Permissions" icon="shield-halved">
    Your user type (ADMIN or CLIENT) determines which dashboard you access and your base capabilities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resource-Level Permissions" icon="lock">
    Specific resources (like projects) can be shared with you with either **view** or **manage** access.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## User Type Comparison

The table below shows the differences between the two types of users:

| Feature | Admin Users | Client Users |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Dashboard Access** | **Admin Dashboard** | **Customer Dashboard** |
| **Primary Focus** | Foundry usage and management | Model usage and tracking |
| **User Management** | ✅ Can invite & manage users | ❌ Cannot manage users |
| **Cluster Management** | ✅ Can register & manage clusters | ❌ Cannot view clusters |
| **Model Repository** | ✅ Full access to add/edit models | ✅ View published models |
| **Project Management** | ✅ Create & manage multiple projects | ✅ Create & manage own projects |
| **Deployment Management** | ✅ Create & manage deployment | ✅ View published models |
| **Playground Access** | ✅ Test models interactively | ✅ Test models interactively |
| **Observability** | ✅ View all org metrics | ✅ View own project metrics |
| **API Keys** | ✅ Create & manage API keys | ✅ Create & manage API keys |
| **Billing Access** | ✅ View & manage org billing | ✅ View own usage only |
| **Default Setup** | No default project or billing | Auto-created default project + free billing plan |

## Resource-Level Permissions

Resource-level permissions allow you to share specific resources with other users, granting them either **view** (read-only) or **manage** (full access) permissions.


| Resource Type | Permission Types | What Gets Shared |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Models | `view`, `manage` | Access to model registry |
| Clusters | `view`, `manage` | Access to clusters |
| Projects | `view`, `manage` | Project + all deployments, and data within |
| Deployments | `view`, `manage` | Access within a project |
| User | `view`, `manage` | Access to user management |

<Note>
**Deployments** belong to projects, so access is automatically inherited from project permissions. If you share a project with someone, they get access to all deployments within that project.
</Note>

### Permission Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="View Permission" icon="eye">
    **Read-only access** to a project. Users can see the project, deployments, and metrics but cannot make changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manage Permission" icon="pen-to-square">
    **Full access** to a project. Users can view, edit, delete, deploy models, and configure everything within the project.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Resource Permissions Work

Resource permissions allow you to share specific **projects** with other users:

1. **Project Owner**: Automatically gets `manage` permission on projects they create
2. **Collaborators**: Can be granted `view` or `manage` permission on shared projects
3. **Inheritance**: Project permissions automatically apply to all sub-resources (deployments within the project)
