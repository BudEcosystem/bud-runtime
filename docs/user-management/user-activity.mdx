- **Troubleshooting** support for debugging issues
- **Usage analytics** for understanding platform adoption

<Note>
Only Admin users with USER_VIEW or USER_MANAGE permissions can access user activity logs.

- **Last 30 days**: Monthly trends
- **Custom range**: Specify exact dates

### Filter by Action Type

Focus on specific actions:
- CREATE
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- LOGIN
- LOGIN_FAILED

### Filter by Resource Type

See activity for specific resources:
- USER
- PROJECT
- MODEL
- ENDPOINT
- CLUSTER
- BENCHMARK

### Filter by User

View activity for specific team members:
- Select from user dropdown
- Search by name or email
- View all actions by that user

## Team Usage Analytics

### Activity Metrics

Track overall team engagement:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Active Users" icon="users">
    Number of users who logged in during the period
  </Card>
  <Card title="Total Actions" icon="bolt">
    All actions performed across the organization
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resource Changes" icon="pen-to-square">
    CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE operations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Usage Patterns

Identify:
- **Peak Usage Times**: When your team is most active
- **Popular Features**: Which features are used most
- **Inactive Users**: Users who haven't logged in recently
- **Power Users**: Most active team members

### Resource Activity

See which resources are most actively managed:
- Projects with most changes
- Frequently accessed models
- Heavily used endpoints
- Active clusters

## Security Monitoring

### Suspicious Activity Detection

Watch for potential security issues:

<Accordion title="Multiple Failed Login Attempts">
  Several failed logins from same IP address may indicate brute force attack. Review IP and consider blocking if necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unusual Login Locations">
  User logging in from unexpected geographic location. Verify with user or investigate potential account compromise.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="After-Hours Activity">
  Activity outside normal working hours. Could be legitimate or indicate unauthorized access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Bulk Deletions">
  Large number of resources deleted quickly. May indicate malicious activity or accidental bulk action.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Escalations">
  User role changed to higher privilege level. Verify this was intentional and authorized.
</Accordion>

### Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**: Check audit logs weekly
2. **Alert Setup**: Configure notifications for suspicious activities
3. **Failed Login Monitoring**: Investigate repeated failures
4. **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict access to known IPs when possible
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable for sensitive accounts

</Steps>

## Use Cases

### Compliance Auditing

**Scenario**: Annual security audit requires proof of access controls

**Solution**:
1. Export all USER actions for the audit period
2. Filter by CREATE and UPDATE to show user management
3. Demonstrate proper role assignments and changes
4. Show audit trail of who made what changes

### Troubleshooting

**Scenario**: User reports they can't access a project

**Solution**:
1. View user's recent activity
2. Check for any DELETE actions on projects
3. Review permission UPDATE actions
4. Identify when access changed and by whom

### Security Investigation

**Scenario**: Suspicious activity detected on account

**Solution**:
1. Filter LOGIN and LOGIN_FAILED for the user
2. Check IP addresses and locations
3. Review recent actions for unauthorized changes
4. Identify timeline of suspicious activity

### Team Performance

**Scenario**: Understanding team productivity and engagement

**Solution**:
1. View activity metrics for all users
2. Identify most/least active team members
3. See which features are used most
4. Plan training based on usage patterns

## Troubleshooting Activity Logs

### Missing Activity Data

If expected actions aren't showing:

1. Check date range filter
2. Verify you have USER_VIEW permission
3. Ensure user exists and has taken actions
4. Contact support if issue persists

### Incomplete Action Details

Some actions may have limited details:
- Actions from API vs UI may have different details
- System actions may lack user context
- Deleted resources may show ID only

### Export Not Working

If export fails:
1. Try smaller date range
2. Reduce number of filters
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try different format (CSV vs JSON)

## API Reference
