# Custom Rules

<Note>
Custom probes and rules are not yet available. This feature is planned for a future release.
</Note>

## Overview

Custom rules will allow you to create organization-specific detection probes tailored to your unique requirements. This includes:

- **Custom Probes**: Define new detection categories specific to your domain or policies
- **Custom Rules**: Create detection patterns within probes for fine-grained control
- **Domain-Specific Filtering**: Build guardrails for industry-specific compliance needs

## Planned Capabilities

### Custom Probe Creation

Create probes that detect content specific to your organization:

- Define probe name, description, and detection purpose
- Specify guard types (input, output, or both)
- Set default severity thresholds
- Associate with specific modality types

### Custom Rule Definition

Within custom probes, define rules that specify:

- Detection patterns and keywords
- Contextual matching criteria
- Rule-specific severity thresholds
- Examples of content to flag

### Use Cases

Custom rules will support scenarios such as:

- **Brand Protection**: Detect competitor mentions or brand guideline violations
- **Industry Compliance**: Create rules for HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or other regulatory requirements
- **Internal Policies**: Enforce organization-specific content guidelines
- **Domain Terminology**: Flag or allow industry-specific terms

## Current Alternatives

While custom rules are not yet available, you can:

1. **Use existing probes**: Combine built-in probes from Bud Sentinel, OpenAI, and Azure Content Safety
2. **Configure thresholds**: Adjust severity thresholds to tune detection sensitivity
3. **Enable/disable rules**: Fine-tune existing probes by enabling or disabling specific rules
4. **Layer providers**: Use multiple providers for comprehensive coverage

See [Content Filtering](/guardrails/content-filtering) for details on configuring existing probes and profiles.
