## 1. Description

Bud Sentinel is Bud’s proprietary guardrail provider and security layer that brings secure evaluation and runtime trust to the Bud platform. In Bud AI Foundry, Bud Sentinel powers the guardrails workflow with a curated catalog of probes (over 300+), low-latency enforcement (under 10 ms), and a guided experience to select probes, configure rules, and deploy guardrails to projects and endpoints. Bud Sentinel is licensed separately and syncs probes automatically, so newly released detection capabilities appear in the catalog without manual updates.

Bud Sentinel focuses on a zero-trust model lifecycle: models are evaluated in isolated sandboxes, scanned for malicious artifacts, and monitored during inference. This lets teams adopt open models while keeping model artifacts and runtime environments continuously protected.

## 2. USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)

### 1. Zero‑trust evaluation for model ingestion

Bud Sentinel validates every model in a sandboxed environment, preventing untrusted artifacts from entering production pipelines.

### 2. Deep artifact scanning beyond antivirus

Model packages are scanned for executable binaries, suspicious payloads, and malicious metadata before they reach shared storage.

### 3. Runtime trust with continuous monitoring

Bud Sentinel monitors inference workloads for unusual access patterns, privileged operations, and unexpected network activity, with detailed logs for forensic review.

### 4. 300+ probes with sub‑10 ms latency

The Bud Sentinel probe catalog delivers high‑accuracy detection across PII, safety, bias, and security categories without slowing down applications.

### 5. Simple, guided guardrail deployment

Bud Admin’s multi‑step workflow makes it easy to choose Bud Sentinel, pick probes, configure rules, and deploy guardrails to projects and endpoints.

### 6. Automatic probe synchronization

Bud Sentinel probes and rules sync on a scheduled cadence, ensuring detection coverage stays up to date without manual refreshes.

### 7. Broad model format coverage

Supports common model packaging formats such as H5, Pickle, Safetensors, and TensorFlow SavedModel to keep security consistent across stacks.

### 8. Performance‑conscious protection

Bud Sentinel is recommended as the default guardrail provider with high accuracy and low latency for production‑grade safety.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Secure model ingestion pipeline

- Downloads and preprocesses models inside a locked‑down sandbox.
- Performs deep scanning across weights, scripts, binaries, and metadata.
- Blocks and quarantines suspicious artifacts before they enter shared storage.

### 3.2 Protected model registry and object storage

- Validated assets are promoted to secure object storage after passing checks.
- Registry gating prevents untrusted models from reaching downstream consumers.

### 3.3 Runtime trust monitoring

- Continuous monitoring during inference detects suspicious file reads, privileged access attempts, or unexpected network connections.
- Centralized logs enable audit trails and forensic review when anomalies appear.

### 3.4 Bud Sentinel probe catalog in Guardrails

- Select Bud Sentinel as a provider and browse its probe catalog from the Guardrails workflow.
- Search and filter probes by category (PII, Bias, All) and tags.
- Open a “See more” drawer to review probe details before deployment.

### 3.5 Deployment‑ready guardrail configuration

- Selected Bud Sentinel probes carry into the deployment flow for projects and endpoints.
- PII probes trigger additional configuration steps before deployment.

## 5. FAQ

**Q1. Is Bud Sentinel included by default?**

Bud Sentinel is a proprietary service that requires a separate license. The container image is gated and needs valid credentials before it can be pulled.

**Q2. How often does Bud Sentinel refresh probes and rules?**

Bud Sentinel probes and rules automatically sync on a scheduled cadence (every 7 days), so new detection capabilities appear without manual action.

**Q3. What happens if I select PII probes?**

Bud Sentinel adds a PII rule configuration step where you can enable or disable specific PII detection rules before deploying.

**Q4. Can I select multiple probes in one guardrail profile?**

Yes. Bud Sentinel allows multi‑select across probes, and each probe is carried into the deployment workflow.

**Q5. What model formats does Bud Sentinel support for secure evaluation?**

Bud Sentinel supports common formats such as H5, Pickle, safetensors, and TensorFlow SavedModel to keep model ingestion secure across ML workflows.
