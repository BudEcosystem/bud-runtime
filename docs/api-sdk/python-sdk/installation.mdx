## Overview

The **BudAI Foundry SDK** is the official Python SDK for the BudAI Foundry Platform. It provides:

- Full-featured client library for the BudAI Foundry API
- OpenAI-compatible inference endpoints (chat, embeddings, classifications)
- DAG-based pipeline definition and execution
- Command-line interface (`bud` CLI) for pipeline operations
- Both synchronous and asynchronous client support
- Complete type hints with Pydantic models

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.8 or higher
- **pip:** Latest version recommended

## Install from GitHub

Install directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/BudEcosystem/BudAIFoundry-SDK

client = BudClient()
print("BudAI Foundry SDK installed successfully!")
```

Verify the CLI is available:

```bash
bud --version
```
