description: "Interactive workspace to experiment with Bud Playground’s chat, code, template, and comparison tools"

## 1. Description

The Playground in Bud Admin opens the BudPlayground experience (gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PLAYGROUND` and the configured `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAYGROUND_URL`) so teams can exercise GenAI models without wiring client code. It provides real-time inference, model comparison, prompt templates, code-focused views, streaming output, and export options to keep experimentation fast and repeatable across supported providers.

## 2. USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)

### 1. Interactive testing with streaming feedback

Run live inference with streaming responses, adjustable decoding parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p), and a chat interface so users can iterate quickly on prompts and observe results in real time.

### 2. Built-in comparison workflow

Compare models side-by-side in dedicated panes to spot quality or latency differences using the same prompts and independent parameter settings.

### 3. Prompt templates and code-oriented modes

Start from pre-built templates for common tasks or switch to code generation views to tailor prompts for completion scenarios without manual setup.

### 4. Export-ready results

Export conversations and comparison outcomes so findings can be shared or reused in downstream workflows.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Access and navigation

- Enable the Playground feature flag in Bud Admin `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PLAYGROUND=true`) and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAYGROUND_URL` to the BudPlayground host so the **Playground** entry appears in the side menu.

- Use the redirect at `/playground` to reach the BudPlayground interface from Bud Admin.

### 3.2 Chat and single-model testing

- Use the chat interface to send prompts to a selected model, with controls for temperature, top-k, top-p, and other generation parameters.

- View streaming responses, inspect generated content, and refine prompts iteratively.

### 3.3 Model comparison

- Open the comparison workflow to place two or more models side-by-side.

- Send the same prompt to each model and review outputs together to judge quality or latency differences.

### 3.4 Prompt templates and code generation

- Browse prompt templates for common tasks and load them into the editor for quick trials.

- Switch to code-generation-oriented views to craft completions or code-specific prompts.

### 3.5 Response analysis and export

- Review response details and performance insights surfaced alongside model outputs.

- Export conversations or comparison runs to share findings or keep reproducible records.

## 4. How-to Guides

### 4.1 Access the Playground

1. In Bud Admin, ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PLAYGROUND` is set to `true` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAYGROUND_URL` points to your BudPlayground deployment.

2. Click **Playground** in the side navigation (or visit `/playground`) to open the interface.

### 4.2 Run a chat against a single model

1. Open the Playground and select a model from the model selector.

2. Adjust decoding parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p) as needed.

3. Enter your prompt in the chat and send to view streaming output.

4. Refine prompts and resend until you achieve the desired response, then export if you want to share the result.

### 4.3 Compare multiple models

1. Switch to the comparison view.

2. Add two or more models to the comparison panes.

3. Enter a shared prompt and send to evaluate outputs together.

4. Export or capture the comparison summary for later reference.

### 4.4 Use prompt templates and code-focused modes

1. Open the templates section and choose a template for your task.

2. Load the template into the editor and adjust variables or parameters.

3. For code use cases, switch to the code generation view to tailor completions before running.

### 4.5 Export conversations or comparisons

1. After finishing a chat or comparison, select the export option.

2. Choose the format offered by the interface to save the conversation or comparison results.

## 5. FAQs

**Q1. How do I turn on the Playground in Bud Admin?**

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PLAYGROUND=true` and provide a `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAYGROUND_URL` so the Playground link is available in the Bud Admin navigation.

**Q2. Which experiments does Playground support?**

Playground includes interactive chat testing, side-by-side model comparisons, prompt templates, code generation views, and exportable results.

**Q3. Can I tune model parameters while testing?**

Yes. Temperature, top-k, and top-p controls are available so you can adjust generation settings between runs.

**Q4. How do I capture results for stakeholders?**

Use the export option in the Playground to save conversations or comparison outputs for sharing or downstream analysis.
