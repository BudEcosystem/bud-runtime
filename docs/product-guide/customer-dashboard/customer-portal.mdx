## 1. Description

The Customer Dashboard portal is the end-user console for Bud customers to discover models, test prompts, monitor inference traffic, manage API credentials, and track usage and billing in one workspace. It provides a guided, drawer-based experience for viewing model details, project metadata, and API key security while surfacing observability and audit insights for operational trust.

This portal balances self-service and governance: teams can browse models and pricing, generate secure credentials scoped to projects, review usage and billing alerts, and trace inference requests down to raw gateway payloads. Deployments published from Bud AI Foundry appear in the models listing so teams can immediately use them without leaving the portal.

## 2. USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)

### 1. One console for discovery, execution, and governance

From model discovery to inference observability, users manage the entire lifecycle in a single dashboard without context switching.

### 2. Playground-first validation

Instant, in-portal testing means teams can validate prompts, latency, and responses before shipping to production.

### 3. Foundry-controlled pricing and quotas

Bud AI Foundry admins can set model token pricing (including zero-cost access) and define user-level custom token and cost quotas to control usage in the Customer Dashboard.

### 4. Actionable observability with deep request detail

Metrics charts, request filtering, and trace-level detail pages let teams troubleshoot latency, token usage, and failures with precision.

### 5. Secure-by-default API key workflows

API key creation, revocation, and encrypted display workflows are built into project context to minimize credential sprawl.

### 6. Usage transparency with proactive billing alerts

Real-time spend and token analytics plus threshold-based alerts provide immediate clarity on costs and guardrails.

### 7. Role-friendly navigation and shortcuts

A consistent sidebar, quick keyboard shortcuts, and collapse/expand views keep navigation efficient for daily operations.

Browse models, test interactions in the playground, manage API keys and projects, monitor usage, configure billing alerts, and review observability and audit logs in one place.

**Q2. Which filters are available in Logs?**

You can filter by date range, endpoint type, model, token thresholds, max latency, and success-only status. Quick presets speed up time-based filtering.

**Q3. How do I access a model’s API snippet?**

Open the model detail drawer, go to **Use Model**, pick a language, and copy the snippet for the model’s supported endpoint.

**Q4. How are API keys secured?**

Keys are generated per project, shown once in detail drawers with show/hide controls, and can be revoked immediately when needed.
