## Overview

The **Deployments** module is where a project turns models into live endpoints. It centralizes endpoint creation, runtime tuning, publishing, and lifecycle operations for both cloud and local models.

From a single project tab, teams can deploy workloads, monitor status, control reliability policies, and expose approved endpoints to downstream consumers.

## Why Deployments Matter

**Immediate endpoint usability after deploy** Once a model is deployed and active, the endpoint is available. Use **Use this model** to copy cURL, Python, or JavaScript snippets for integration.

**Separate publish workflow for customer portal** **Publish** is used to expose models in the **Customer Dashboard portal** with pricing metadata for customer consumption.

**Built-in reliability controls** Configure retries, fallback chains, and rate limiting directly from deployment settings.

**Production visibility** Track endpoint health and review runtime details through deployment-level tabs.

## Core Areas in Deployments

| Area                | What you can do                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deployment List** | Search, filter, deploy, publish, and manage project endpoints |
| **General Tab**     | Review model/cluster metadata and deployment status           |
| **Workers Tab**     | Inspect and scale workers for local deployments               |
| **Settings Tab**    | Set rate limits, retries, and fallback behavior               |

## Typical Workflow

1. Open a project and navigate to **Deployments**.
2. Deploy a model with the right cluster and runtime profile.
3. Validate endpoint readiness from deployment details.
4. Use **Use this model** to copy integration snippets and test endpoint calls.
5. Publish with pricing metadata only when you want the model available in the **Customer Dashboard portal**.
