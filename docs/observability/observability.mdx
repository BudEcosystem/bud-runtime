## 1. Description

The Bud Admin observability workspace centralizes inference analytics across models, deployments, projects, and users. It unifies runtime health, request analytics, and alerting so platform, MLOps, and FinOps teams can keep hybrid and multi-cloud deployments reliable.

The module is optimized for AI-specific signals (latency, token/cost per request, model/route attribution) and ties them to infrastructure events, giving operators immediate context when tuning scaling policies or debugging incidents.

## 2. USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)

### 1. AI-native, multi-accelerator coverage

Single-pane monitoring for heterogeneous fleets (CPU, GPU, HPU, TPU etc) with AI-aware metrics such as prompt/response latency, token throughput, and model-specific error rates.

### 2. Rich Inference Analytics

End-to-end metrics include request volumes, latency distributions, token usage, throughput (RPS), TTFT, and geographic breakdowns rendered as cards and charts.

### 3. Request-level visibility

Searchable, filterable request tables link directly to detail pages with full payloads, metadata, copy/download actions, and trace-friendly IDs.

### 4. Governed blocking rules

Rules manage IP, country, user-agent, and rate-based blocking with stats, filters, creation drawers, and audited delete confirmations, keeping enforcement aligned with deployments.

### 5. Consistent search, filter, and export

Global search, time-range presets, tab-level filters, and CSV/JSON exports are available across metrics and requests for repeatable investigations.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Unified observability workspace

- Left navigation entry for Observability with tabs for Metrics, Requests, and Rules plus shared time-range controls and refresh actions.
- Search, filter, and export patterns mirror the broader Bud Admin UI, including saved range presets and CSV outputs for tables.

### 3.2 Metrics tab

- View by Model / Deployment / Project / User segmented control to pivot charts and groupings without changing context.
- Key cards for total requests, success/failure rates, latency (avg/p95/p99), and token totals per time range.
- Charts for request volume over time, latency distribution, geographic origin, token usage, requests per second, and TTFT with series colored per selected view dimension.
- Time-range presets (1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d, 3mo) and calendar picker apply consistently to all metrics queries.

### 3.3 Requests tab

- Inference request table with timestamp, project, deployment, prompt preview, response time, tokens, and success/failure status columns plus sortable fields for timestamp and response time.
- Filters for project and additional attributes through the shared InferenceFilters component, paired with search-by-text input and reload/export controls.
- Row click opens the request detail page, preserving applied filters and time range for context.

### 3.4 Rules tab

- Statistics cards summarizing total rules, active rules, and recent blocks (today/this week).
- Filters for rule type (IP, country, user-agent, rate-based) and status (active/inactive) plus counts of how many rules match the current view.
- Actions to create a rule, view a rule, edit, and delete with confirmation.

### 3.5 Governance and auditability

- Rules and request exports reuse centralized loaders and confirmation prompts, ensuring user actions are surfaced and reversible where applicable.
- Request details expose trace-friendly identifiers (inference ID, API key) and copy/download buttons for raw payloads to support audit workflows.

## 4. How-to Guides

### 4.1 Accessing the module

1. In Bud Admin, open **Observability** from the left navigation.
2. Set a time range with presets or the date picker; changes apply across Metrics and Requests tabs.
3. Use search and filters to scope the active tab before drilling into charts, tables, or rule lists.

### 4.2 Metrics tab actions

- **Pivot the view**: Select **Model**, **Deployment**, **Project**, or **User** to regroup charts and lines by that dimension.
- **Adjust time**: Apply presets or custom ranges; the tab reloads metrics using the selected window.
- **Review key cards**: Scan request totals, success/failure ratios, latency percentiles, and token counts for the window.
- **Explore charts**: Use request volume, latency distribution, geo map, tokens over time, RPS, and TTFT visualizations to spot regressions by the selected grouping.

### 4.3 Requests tab actions

- **Search & filter**: Combine **InferenceFilters** (project and request attributes) with the search bar for prompt/response text to trim the list before analysis.
- **Sort & scan**: Sort by timestamp or latency and review prompt previews, token counts, and status badges in the table.
- **Export**: Download filtered rows as CSV/JSON for offline review via the Export button in the header.

#### 4.3.1 Request detail page

- **Open request**: Click any row to load the detail page showing overview fields (latency, tokens, cache flag, status) and request metadata (IP, method, path, auth, client info, location).
- **Inspect payloads**: Raw gateway request/response blocks include copy and download buttons for JSON exports, plus formatted message content for chat-style payloads.
- **Trace IDs**: Copy inference and trace identifiers for use in external tracing or incident reports.

### 4.4 Rules tab actions

- **Review stats**: Check total, active, and recent block counts at the top of the Rules tab to gauge enforcement impact.
- **Filter the list**: Use rule type (IP, country, user-agent, rate-based) and status (active/inactive) selectors to narrow results; counts update as filters change.
- **Lifecycle actions**: Create new blocking rules via the drawer, open existing rules to view details, edit configurations, or delete with confirmation and loader feedback.

#### 4.4.1 Rule detail drawer

- **Open rule**: Choose **View** on any row to load the drawer with rule properties, type, scope, and current status (active/inactive).
- **Evaluate status**: Use the active/inactive state and recent block counts to decide whether to adjust thresholds or disable the rule.

#### 4.4.2 Create rule flow

- **Start**: Select **Create Rule** to open the creation drawer.
- **Configure**: Choose a rule type (IP, country, user-agent, rate-based), set scope, and define activation state before saving.
- **Save & review**: After creation, verify the new rule appears in the list with updated totals and matches the intended status.

### 4.5 Request and trace troubleshooting

1. In **Requests**, filter by project and time to isolate the affected window, then sort by latency to surface slow calls.
2. Open a request to inspect metadata (method, path, auth, client IP, user agent, location) and confirm whether blocks or failures align with rule coverage.
3. Copy and download raw gateway payloads for replay or deeper tracing, ensuring sensitive fields remain redacted as stored.

### 4.6 Rule hygiene and enforcement checks

1. Review Rules tab stats to ensure active blocking aligns with current traffic patterns.
2. Filter by rule type/status to confirm coverage (e.g., active rate limits for high-traffic deployments).
3. Use the create/edit flows to update thresholds or disable rules; deletions prompt confirmation to avoid accidental removals.

### 4.7 Search, filter, and export best practices

- Use time presets for quick pivots during incidents, then refine with the date picker for exact comparisons.
- Combine table filters and text search before exporting to minimize post-processing; exports respect the active filters and sort order.
- Prefer JSON exports for payload fidelity (requests, rules) and CSV for spreadsheet-friendly tabular analysis.
