## 1. Description

The API Keys module in Bud Admin centralizes how teams create, store, and govern credentials that power Bud AI Foundry’s API access. It blends provider credentials (for cloud model access), project-scoped API keys (for consumption and budgeting), and cloud provider integrations into one workflow so admins can enforce visibility, expiry, and usage controls across the organization.

The module is built for enterprise environments where a single platform must support multiple projects, providers, and deployment footprints. It keeps credentials organized with searchable listings, structured detail views, and secure drawer-based workflows for creation, editing, and deletion.

## 2. USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)

### 1. Unified credential workspace

Manage provider credentials, project keys, and cloud provider connections in one module with dedicated tabs for each asset type.

### 2. Governance-ready workflows

Use controlled drawers with explicit Create, Save, and Delete actions, plus confirmation prompts, to keep key lifecycle events auditable and intentional.

### 3. Project-aware security

Project-level keys capture expiry and max budget so usage can be tracked and capped per team or workload.

### 4. Fast discovery and filtering

Search by name, filter by provider or project, and sort by key metadata to locate credentials quickly across large catalogs.

### 5. Secure key visibility controls

Sensitive key values remain hidden by default with reveal and copy actions available only within the secure detail drawer.

## 5. FAQ

### Q1. What is the difference between provider credentials and project keys?

Provider credentials store secrets used to access external model providers. Project keys are API keys scoped to a Bud project, with expiry and budget controls for usage tracking.

### Q2. How do I restrict which project a key can access?

Project keys are created with a single project assignment. Use the **Project** selector during key creation to scope access.

### Q3. Can I hide or reveal keys safely?

Yes. Keys are masked by default. Use the eye icon in the detail drawer to reveal the value and the copy icon to copy it securely.

### Q4. How do I clean up unused credentials?

Open the credential or key detail drawer and use the action menu to delete it. Deletion requires confirmation to prevent accidental removal.

### Q5. What filters are available?

- **Provider tab:** filter by provider.
- **Projects tab:** filter by project.
- Both tabs support name search, column sorting, and pagination.

### Q6. Why do I see a Cloud Providers tab?

The **Cloud Providers** tab is visible when dev mode is enabled. It lets you connect cloud infrastructure providers and manage their credentials separately from model provider credentials.

### Q7. Can I control how long a project API key stays valid??

Yes. Each project key is created with an expiry (currently selectable as 30 or 60 days) and can be updated later from the key detail drawer.

### Q8. How do I know where a provider credential is used?

The provider credential detail drawer includes a **Deployments** table that lists the model deployments using that credential, along with project, model, status, and creation date.
