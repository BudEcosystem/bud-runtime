Ask Bud is a microservices-based system designed to simplify interaction with your inference stack. It empowers users to retrieve crucial information about their clusters, deployments, models, and more, using intuitive natural language queries.

This service acts as a natural language interface, translating user requests into actions that gather and present the desired details from your inference environment. With Ask Bud, accessing and understanding the state of your inference infrastructure becomes as easy as asking a question.
