1. SERVICES.

   1.1. Overview of the Services.
   The Services provide users with a multimodal artificial
   intelligence (“AI”) model that understands text, images, videos
   and audio, executing actions via code. Reka’s model excels in
   processing long contextual documents, facilitating fast
   retrieval, augmented generation, and supports up to thirty-one
   (31) languages.

   1.2. Reka Tools.
   Subject to this Agreement, Reka makes available to you certain
   AI tools in connection with your use of the Services
   (collectively, the “Reka Tools”). Except where expressly
   specified otherwise in this Agreement, the Reka Tools
   constitute a “Service” for the purposes of the Agreement and
   the Agreement shall apply in full to Customer’s use of the Reka
   Tools. The Reka Tools leverage certain large language models
   and AI algorithms to generate ideas and answer basic questions
   (collectively, the “Output”) in response to your prompts
   (“Prompts”). You acknowledge that the Outputs are based on your
   Prompts, and that Reka has no control over any such Prompts.
   Accordingly, all Outputs are provided “as is” and with “all
   faults”, and Reka makes no representations or warranties of any
   kind or nature with respect to any Outputs, including any
   warranties of accuracy, completeness, truthfulness, timeliness
   or suitability. You are solely responsible for your use of your
   Outputs created through the Services, and you assume all risks
   associated with your use of your Outputs, including any
   potential copyright infringement claims from third parties or
   any disclosure of your Outputs that personally identifies you
   or any third party.

   1.3. Supplemental Terms.
   Your use of, and participation in, certain features and
   functionality of the Services may be subject to additional
   terms (“Supplemental Terms”). Such Supplemental Terms will
   either be set forth in the applicable supplemental Services or
   will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up
   to use the supplemental Service. If these Terms of Use are
   inconsistent with the Supplemental Terms, then the Supplemental
   Terms control with respect to such supplemental Service.

   1.4. Updates.
   You understand that the Services are evolving. As a result,
   Reka may require you to install updates to the Applications
   that you have installed on the devices through which you access
   or use the Services (“Device”). You acknowledge and agree that
   Reka may update the Services with or without notifying you. You
   may need to update third-party software from time to time in
   order to continue to use the Services. Any future release,
   update or other addition to the Services shall be subject to
   this Agreement.

   1.5. Reka Communications.
   By entering into this Agreement or using the Services, you

   OPTIONS IN THE PROMOTIONAL EMAIL ITSELF.

2. REGISTRATION.

   2.1. Registering Your Account.

   2.2. Registration Data.
   In registering an Account, you agree to (a) provide true,

   accurate, current and complete. You are responsible for all
   activities that occur under your Account. You agree to monitor
   your Account to restrict use by minors, and you will accept

   minors. If you provide any information that is untrue,
   inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Reka has reasonable
   grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue,
   inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Reka has the right to
   suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all
   current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof).
   You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or
   information, or on behalf of someone other than yourself. Reka
   reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any
   time and for any reason, including but not limited to, claims
   by a third party that a username violates the third party’s

   reviewing any Output prior to your use and exercising your own
   judgement as to its suitability for use. Without limiting the

   Agreement, you shall not use any Prompts or Output that: (a)
   infringe or misappropriates any third party’s intellectual
   property rights or other proprietary rights; (b) are deceptive,

   with this Section. In addition to the foregoing, your
   obligations under the Agreement with respect to use of the
   Services, your representations and warranties and
   indemnification obligations, shall apply in full with respect
   to your use of the Reka Tools. You acknowledge and agree that,

   have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of
   Your Content, including without limitation chat, text, or other
   communications.

   Without limiting the foregoing, Reka reserves the right to: (a)
   remove or refuse to post any of Your Content for any or no
   reason in our sole discretion; (b) take any action with respect
   to any of Your Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in
   our sole discretion, including if we believe that such content
   violates this Agreement, infringes any intellectual property
   right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the
   personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or
   could create liability for Reka; (c) disclose your identity or
   other information about you to any third party who claims that
   material posted by you violates their rights, including their
   intellectual property rights or their right to privacy; (d)
   take appropriate legal action, including without limitation,
   referral to and cooperation with law enforcement and/or other
   applicable legal authorities, for any illegal or unauthorized
   use of the Services or if Reka otherwise believes that criminal
   activity has occurred; and/or (e) terminate or suspend your
   access to all or part of the Services for any or no reason,
   including without limitation, any violation of this Agreement.
   Upon determination of any possible violations by you of any
   provision of this Agreement, Reka, may, at its sole discretion
   immediately terminate your license to use the Services, or
   change, alter or remove Your Content, in whole or in part,
   without prior notice to you.

   has no obligation to store
   any of Your Content. Reka has no responsibility or liability
   for the deletion or accuracy of any Content, including Your

   Website, Third-Party Application or Third-Party Ad, we may not

   Reka. Reka is not responsible for any Third-Party Websites,
   Third-Party Applications or Third-Party Ads. Reka provides
   these Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications and
   Third-Party Ads only as a convenience and does not review,
   approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations
   with respect to Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications

   and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices,

   Third-Party Ads, and make whatever investigation you feel
   necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction
   with any third party.

7. FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS.

   7.1. Third-Party Service Provider.
   Reka uses Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates (“Stripe”) as its
   third-party service providers for payment services (e.g., card
   acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services)
   (“Third-Party Service Providers”). If you make a purchase on
   the Services, you will be required to provide your payment
   details and any additional information required to complete
   your order directly to our Third-Party Service Provider. [You
   agree to be bound by Stripe’s Privacy Policy (currently
   accessible at https://stripe.com/us/privacy) and its Terms of
   Service (currently accessible at https://stripe.com/ssa) and
   hereby consent and authorize Reka, Stripe to share any
   information and payment instructions you provide with one or
   more Third-Party Service Provider(s) to the minimum extent
   required to complete your transactions. Please note that online
   payment transactions may be subject to validation checks by our
   Third-Party Service Providers and your card issuer, and we are
   not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorize
   payment for any reason. For your protection, our Third-Party
   Service Providers use various fraud prevention protocols and
   industry standard verification systems to reduce fraud and you
   authorize it to verify and authenticate your payment
   information. Your card issuer may charge you an online handling
   fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this. In some
   jurisdictions, our Third-Party Service Providers may use third
   parties under strict confidentiality and data protection
   requirements for the purposes of payment processing services.

   7.2. Payment.
   You agree to pay all fees or charges (“Fees”) to your Account
   in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in
   effect at the time a Fee is due and payable as set forth on
   Reka’s pricing page, available at https://reka.ai/pricing. By
   providing Reka and/or our Third-Party Service Provider with
   your payment information, you agree that Reka and/or our
   Third-Party Service Provider is authorized to immediately
   invoice your Account for all Fees due and payable to Reka
   hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required.
   You shall immediately notify Reka of any change in your payment
   information to maintain its completeness and accuracy. Reka
   reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing
   methods in its sole discretion. You agree to have sufficient
   funds or credit available upon placement of any order to ensure
   that the purchase price is collectible by us. Your failure to
   provide accurate payment information to Reka and/or our
   Third-Party Service Provider or our inability to collect
   payment constitutes your material breach of this Agreement.
   Except as set forth in this Agreement, all Fees for the
   Services are non-refundable.

   7.3. Credits.
   To purchase certain Services, you may be required to add usage
   credits (“Usage Credits”) to your Account in order to pre-pay
   for your access to Reka’s API purchased through the Services.
   You may add Usage Credits in any increment presented to you at
   the point of purchase. The amount that you add to your Account
   shall be charged in accordance with Section 7.2 when you
   confirm the addition of such Usage Credits to your Account.
   Usage Credits may only be used in connection with the purchases
   you make through the Services, and any purchase you make to
   facilitate your access to the API will result in a deduction in
   Usage Credits from your Account balance. Any unused Usage
   Credits will remain in your Account, and you may review and
   determine your remaining Account balance by visiting your
   Account. If the cost of your API usage exceeds the amount of
   Usage Credits in your Account, you will be prompted to add
   additional Usage Credits to your Account. The current pricing
   for Usage Credits is available on the Pricing Page, and is
   subject to change in accordance with Section 7.2. For the
   avoidance of doubt, Usage Credits may not be resold, bartered,
   transferred for value, redeemed for cash, or applied to any
   other account or services, except to the extent required by
   law. Usage Credits are not returnable or refundable for cash
   except in states where required by law, and must be used within
   one (1) year of the date of purchase unless otherwise specified
   at the time of purchase.

   7.4. Taxes.
   The Fees do not include any Sales Tax (defined below) that may
   be due in connection with the Services provided under this
   Agreement. If Reka determines it has a legal obligation to
   collect Sales Tax from you in connection with this Agreement,
   Reka shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the Fees. If
   any services, or payments for any services, under this
   Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and
   you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Reka, you
   shall be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any
   related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority,
   and you shall indemnify Reka for any liability or expense Reka
   may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon Reka’s
   request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by
   the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that
   you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this
   section, “Sales Tax” means any sales or use tax and any other
   tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional
   equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing
   jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

   7.5. Withholding Taxes.
   You shall make all payments of Fees to Reka free and clear of,
   and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such
   taxes imposed on payments of Fees to Reka shall be your sole
   responsibility, and you shall provide Reka with official
   receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such
   other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that
   such taxes have been paid.

8. INDEMNIFICATION.

   You agree to indemnify and hold Reka, its parents,
   subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
   partners, suppliers, and licensors (each, a “Reka Party” and
   collectively, the “Reka Parties”) harmless from any losses,
   costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable
   attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of any and all of
   the following: (a) Your Content (including Prompts); (b) your
   use of, or inability to use, any of the Services; (c) your
   violation of the Agreement; (d) your violation of any rights of
   another party, including any other users; or (e) your violation
   of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. Reka reserves the
   right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and
   control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by
   you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Reka in
   asserting any available defenses. This provision does not
   require you to indemnify any of the Reka Parties for any
   unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such
   party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or
   concealment, or suppression or omission of any material fact in
   connection with the Services provided hereunder. You agree that
   the provisions in this section will survive any termination of
   the Agreement and/or your access to the Services.

   RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE OR DATA, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES OR COSTS DUE TO
   LOSS OF PRODUCTION OR USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR
   PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, IN EACH CASE

   INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF

   It is Reka’s policy to terminate membership privileges of any
   user who repeatedly infringes copyright upon prompt
   notification to Reka by the copyright owner or the copyright
   owner’s legal agent. Without limiting the foregoing, if you
   believe that your work has been copied and posted on the
   Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,
   please provide our Copyright Agent with the following
   information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the
   person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the
   copyright interest; (b) a description of the copyrighted work
   that you claim has been infringed; (c) a description of the
   location on the Services of the material that you claim is
   infringing; (d) your address, telephone number and e-mail
   address; (e) a written statement by you that you have a good
   faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the
   copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement by
   you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information
   in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner
   or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf. Contact

   copyright infringement is as follows: Reka AI Inc., Attn:
   Copyright Agent, 530 Lawrence Expy. PMB 9004, Sunnyvale, CA,

12. TERM AND TERMINATION.

   12.1. Term.
   The Agreement commences on the date when you accept it (as
   described in the preamble above) and remains in full force and
   effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in
   accordance with the Agreement.

   12.2. Termination of Services by Reka.
   If you have materially breached any provision of this
   Agreement, or if Reka is required to do so by law (e.g., where
   the provision of the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), Reka
   has the right to, immediately and without notice, suspend or
   terminate any Services provided to you. Reka reserves the right
   to terminate this Agreement or your access to the Service at
   any time without cause upon notice to you. You agree that all
   terminations for cause are made in Reka’s sole discretion and
   that Reka shall not be liable to you or any third party for any
   termination of your Account.

   12.3. Termination by You.
   If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i)
   notifying Reka at any time and (ii) closing your Account for
   the Service. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to Reka’s
   address set forth below.

   12.4. Effect of Termination.
   Upon termination of the Services or the applicable feature or
   functionality thereof, your right to use the Services or the
   applicable feature or functionality thereof will automatically
   terminate, any remaining unused Usage Credits you purchased
   will be forfeited, and we may delete Your Content associated
   therewith from our live databases. If we terminate your Account
   for cause, we may also bar your further use or access to the
   Services. Reka will not have any liability whatsoever to you
   for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of
   Your Content. All provisions of this Agreement which by their
   nature should survive, will survive termination of Service,
   including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty
   disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

13. INTERNATIONAL USERS.

   The Services can be accessed from countries around the world
   and may contain references to Services and content that are not
   available in your country; however, Reka makes no
   representations that the Services are appropriate or available
   for use in other locations. The Services are controlled and
   offered by Reka from its facilities in the United States of
   America. Those who access or use the Services from other
   countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for
   compliance with local law.

14. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

   Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”)
   carefully. It is part of your contract with Reka and affects
   your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING
   ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

   14.1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
   Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and
   Reka agree that any dispute, claim, or disagreement arising out
   of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the
   Services, any communications you receive through the Services,
   or the Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose
   between us before the effective date of the Agreement (each, a
   “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than
   in court, except that: (1) you and Reka may assert claims or
   seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and
   remain in small claims court; and (2) you or Reka may seek
   equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of
   intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress,
   domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For
   purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also
   include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before
   the existence of this or any prior versions of the Agreement as
   well as claims that may arise after the termination of the
   Agreement.

   14.2. Informal Dispute Resolution.
   There may be instances when a Dispute arises between you and
   Reka. If that occurs, Reka is committed to working with you to
   reach a reasonable resolution. You and Reka agree that good
   faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a
   prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Reka
   therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration
   against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court
   if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer
   telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort
   to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration
   Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you
   are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the
   conference, but you also agree to participate in the
   conference.

   The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other
   party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute
   Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within
   forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such
   Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the
   parties in writing.

   Notice to Reka that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute
   Resolution Conference should be sent by email to
   [40][email protected] and or by mail to Reka AI, Inc., 530
   Lawrence Expy. PMB 9004, Sunnyvale, CA, 94085. The Notice must
   include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address,
   e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one);
   (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail
   address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your
   Dispute.

   The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be
   individualized such that a separate conference must be held
   each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same
   law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in
   similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals
   initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal
   Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the
   time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal
   Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration
   Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal
   communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.
   Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a
   condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled
   before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and
   any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties
   engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process
   required by this section.

   14.3. Waiver of Jury Trial.
   YOU AND REKA HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY
   RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR
   A JURY. You and Reka are instead electing that all Disputes
   shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
   Agreement, except as specified in Section 14.1 above. There is
   no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
   arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

   14.4. Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.
   YOU AND REKA AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 14.9,
   EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN
   INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR
   COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO
   HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR
   ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS
   ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES
   OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
   CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject
   to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award
   declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
   individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
   necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual
   claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it,
   affect the terms and conditions under Section 14.9.
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration
   Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not
   subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations
   of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular
   claim or request for relief (such as a request for public
   injunctive relief), you and Reka agree that that particular
   claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or
   request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and
   may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in
   Santa Clara County, California. All other Disputes shall be
   arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This section
   does not prevent you or Reka from participating in a class-wide
   settlement of claims.

   14.5. Rules and Forum.
   The Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate
   commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with
   respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal
   Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the
   interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement
   and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute
   Resolution Process described above does not resolve
   satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of Notice,
   you and Reka agree that either party shall have the right to
   finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The
   arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration
   and Mediation (“NAM”), in accordance with the Consumer
   Arbitration Rules (the “NAM Rules”) then in effect, except as
   modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. NAM
   Rules are currently available at
   https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/.

   A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the
   other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The
   Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing
   address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and
   the account username (if applicable) as well as the email
   address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement
   of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of
   those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an
   accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy
   in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion
   of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above;
   and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any
   necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.

   If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel,
   the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone
   number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must
   also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel
   certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and
   belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the
   circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for
   any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary
   delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution;
   (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are
   warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for
   extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for
   establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages
   contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so
   identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a
   reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
   Unless you and otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration
   process discussed in Section 14.9 is triggered, the arbitration
   will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to
   the applicable NAM rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited
   and reasonable exchange of information between the parties,
   consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If NAM
   is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an
   alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any NAM
   fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable NAM
   Rules.

   You and Reka agree that all materials and documents exchanged
   during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential
   and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’
   attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject
   to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and
   documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings
   confidential.

   14.6. Arbitrator.
   The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney
   licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be
   selected by the parties from the NAM roster of consumer dispute
   arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
   arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the
   Request, then NAM will appoint the arbitrator in accordance
   with the applicable NAM rules, provided that if the Batch
   Arbitration process under Section 14.9 is triggered, NAM will
   appoint the arbitrator for each batch.

   14.7. Authority of Arbitrator.
   The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any
   Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of
   or related to the interpretation or application of the
   Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability,
   revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement
   or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the
   following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to
   Section 14.4, including any claim that all or part of Section
   14.4 is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that
   Section 14.4 has been breached, shall be decided by a court of
   competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as
   expressly contemplated in Section 14.9, all Disputes about the
   payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of
   competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all
   Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition
   precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of
   competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all
   Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement
   applies shall be decided only by a court of competent
   jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration
   proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or
   joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly
   provided in Section 14.9. The arbitrator shall have the
   authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
   Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
   statement of decision describing the essential findings and
   conclusions on which the award is based, including the
   calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator
   is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the
   arbitration award may be entered in any court having
   jurisdiction.

   14.8. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.
   The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in
   arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the
   substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request
   was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as
   measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
   Procedure 11(b)). If you or Reka need to invoke the authority
   of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration,
   then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in
   such action shall have the right to collect from the other
   party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and
   reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order
   compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court
   action relating to whether either party has satisfied any
   condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal
   Dispute Resolution Process, is entitled to recover their
   reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable
   attorneys’ fees and costs.

   14.9. Batch Arbitration.
   To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of
   arbitrations, you and Reka agree that in the event that there
   are one hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a
   substantially similar nature filed against Reka by or with the
   assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or
   organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as
   possible thereafter), NAM shall (1) administer the arbitration
   demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the
   extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the
   batching described above, a final batch consisting of the
   remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch;
   and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single
   consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and
   administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural
   calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by
   the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).

   All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar
   nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or
   factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and
   seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties
   disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process,
   the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a
   sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the
   Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an
   effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the
   Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative
   Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to
   resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s
   fees shall be paid by Reka.

   You and Reka agree to cooperate in good faith with NAM to
   implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment
   of single filing and administrative fees for batches of
   Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs
   of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a
   discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the
   resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an
   expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch
   Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as
   authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or
   action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or
   consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as
   expressly set forth in this provision.

   14.10. 30-Day Right to Opt Out.
   You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this
   Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your
   decision to opt out to: [41][email protected] or by mail to
   Reka AI, Inc., 530 Lawrence Expy. PMB 9004, Sunnyvale, CA,
   94085, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to
   this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name
   and address, the email address you used to set up your Reka
   account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that
   you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt
   out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this
   Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this
   Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration
   agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the
   future, with us.

   14.11. Invalidity, Expiration.
   Except as provided in Section 14.4, if any part or parts of
   this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be
   invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts
   shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the
   remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full
   force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you
   have with Reka as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must
   be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of
   limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever
   time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes
   of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner
   as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable
   court of competent jurisdiction.

   14.12. Modification.
   Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary,
   we agree that if Reka makes any future material change to this
   Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject
   the change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming
   effective by writing to Reka at: [42][email protected] or by
   mail to Reka AI, Inc., 530 Lawrence Expy. PMB 9004, Sunnyvale,
   CA, 94085, your continued use of the Services, including the
   acceptance of products and services offered on or through the
   Services, following the posting of changes to this Arbitration
   Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.
   Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a
   new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you
   have previously agreed to a version of the Agreement and did
   not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or
   update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an
   existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or
   relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services,
   any communications you receive, the provisions of this
   Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the
   Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Agreement)
   remain in full force and effect. Reka will continue to honor
   any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made
   to a prior version of the Agreement.

15. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

   15.1. Electronic Communications.
   The communications between you and Reka may take place via
   electronic means, whether you visit the Services or send Reka
   e-mails, or whether Reka posts notices on the Services or
   communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you
   (a) consent to receive communications from Reka in an
   electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions,
   agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that
   Reka provides to you electronically satisfy any legal
   requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were
   to be in writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory
   rights, including but not limited to the Electronic Signatures
   in Global and National Commerce Act at 15 U.S.C. §7001 et seq.
   (“E-Sign”).

   15.2. Assignment.
   This Agreement, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may
   not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise
   transferred by you without Reka’s prior written consent, and
   any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer
   in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Reka may
   assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations
   hereunder without your consent.

   15.3. Force Majeure.
   Reka shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform
   resulting from causes outside its reasonable control,
   including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism,
   riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire,
   floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation
   facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
