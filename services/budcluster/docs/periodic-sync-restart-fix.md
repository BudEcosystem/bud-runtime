# Periodic Node Status Sync - Restart Fix

## Problem
The cluster node status sync was stopping for existing clusters after service restart because:
1. Dapr cron binding doesn't automatically re-trigger for all clusters on restart
2. No startup initialization to resume sync for existing clusters
3. No visibility into whether the periodic sync is running

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Startup Initialization
Added a lifespan handler in `main.py` that:
- Triggers an initial node status sync 10 seconds after startup
- Ensures all active clusters get their status updated immediately after restart
- Logs the initialization for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Logging
Improved logging in the periodic sync endpoint:
- Changed from `debug` to `info` level for better visibility
- Added completion status logging
- Tracks last sync time for monitoring

### 3. Health Check Endpoint
Added `/cluster/periodic-node-status-update/health` endpoint that provides:
- Binding configuration status
- Schedule information (@every 3m)
- Last sync timestamp
- Overall health status

## Monitoring

### Check Sync Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/cluster/periodic-node-status-update/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "binding_configured": true,
  "schedule": "@every 3m",
  "last_sync_time": "2025-01-19T10:30:45.123456",
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### Monitor Logs
```bash
# Check for startup sync
docker logs budcluster-container 2>&1 | grep "Initial node status sync"

# Check for periodic sync triggers
docker logs budcluster-container 2>&1 | grep "Periodic node status update"

# Check Dapr sidecar for binding activity
docker logs budcluster-daprd 2>&1 | grep "periodic-node-status"
```

### Manual Trigger
To manually trigger sync for all clusters:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/cluster/periodic-node-status-update
```

## Verification Steps

After service restart:
1. Wait 10 seconds for initial sync to trigger
2. Check health endpoint to confirm binding is configured
3. Monitor logs to see sync activity for all clusters
4. Verify last_sync_time updates every 3 minutes

## Technical Details

### Dapr Binding Behavior
- Dapr cron bindings are stateless - they don't persist state across restarts
- The binding starts fresh after each restart
- First trigger happens based on the schedule (up to 3 minutes wait)

### Our Solution
- Proactive sync on startup ensures immediate consistency
- Health endpoint provides visibility into sync status
- Enhanced logging helps troubleshoot issues

## Future Improvements
Consider:
1. Persisting last sync time in Redis/state store
2. Adding metrics for sync success/failure rates
3. Implementing exponential backoff for failed cluster syncs
4. Adding alerts when sync hasn't run for > 5 minutes
