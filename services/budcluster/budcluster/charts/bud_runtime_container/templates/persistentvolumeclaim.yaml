# NOTE: PVC creation is handled by the model-transfer Helm chart
# The bud-runtime-container chart uses the existing PVC created during model transfer
# This prevents Helm ownership conflicts between the two releases
# The PVC has a "keep" annotation to persist it across helm uninstalls
#
# Commented out to avoid ownership conflict error:
# "PersistentVolumeClaim exists and cannot be imported into the current release"
#
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
